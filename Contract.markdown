## Disclosure

I am more than happy to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in order to work on Your project.

I often like to write and tweet about the projects I am currently working on; if there is no NDA in place I shall assume that You authorise me to do this. Please explicitly state if this is not acceptable before signing this document.

I shall explicitly seek Your consent before open sourcing—or writing in any detail about—any of the code or techniques employed in The Work.

## Payment

As a young business, cash flow is very important to Happily. As such, it is politely request that You meet the payment terms outlined below.

### Deposit

An upfront deposit of 20% is required before commencing with any agreed work. This deposit is non-refundable and will only be paid once a fixed scope has been set, and we are confident that we wish to work together to these agreed terms. No deposit shall be taken until You are completely happy with, and clear about, the agreed scope of The Work and its surrounding terms. Work shall commence as soon as the deposit is received.

### Payment terms

Once a project is deemed complete, an invoice shall be raised for the remaining 80% of the project cost, along with any other incidental costs (see _Expenses_). The remaining balance shall be paid within 14 days of it being invoiced.

### Late payment

Failure to meet agreed payment terms (primarily, but not limited to, late payment) will incur penalty in the form of 10% of the total project cost for each calendar week of late payment. This penalty fee shall be paid on top of any outstanding invoices.

### Expenses

Any expenses (e.g. travel, accommodation, font licenses, etc.) shall be charged
on top of any charges relating directly to The Work.

## tl;dr

Let’s just be respectful and mindful of each other at all times, before, during and after The Work.
